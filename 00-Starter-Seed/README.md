# Auth0 Python Web App Sample

This sample demonstrates how to add authentication to a Python web app using Auth0.

# Running the App

To run the sample, make sure you have `python` and `pip` installed.

Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and populate it with the client ID, domain, and secret for your Auth0 app. Also, add the callback URL to the settings section of your Auth0 client.

Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies and run `python server.py`. The app will be served at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://docs.auth0.com/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional **[username/password databases](https://docs.auth0.com/mysql-connection-tutorial)**.
* Add support for **[linking different user accounts](https://docs.auth0.com/link-accounts)** with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://docs.auth0.com/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://docs.auth0.com/rules).
